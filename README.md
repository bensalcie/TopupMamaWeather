## Requirements
Case study
*   Build a weather app using Kotlin (or java) on android using weather data from public
    weather APIs, visual design to help you through here (not compulsory to use this, just be
    creative):
*   You can add up to 5 cities to the main activity. You can also remove cities from the main activity.
*   When clicking on one of the cities from the main activity, a 5 days forecast should be displayed.
*   When clicking on one of the cities from the search box dropdown, a 5 days forecast should be displayed, while having the ability to include it in the main activity if it's not already included. 
*   The main activity will have the 1st city added by default, which will be based on the GPS location. If the user doesn't give the location permissions, then the first default city will be London, UK.
*   Save the data for offline usage.
*   Extra bonus for creating a widget.



 ###### **What is to be done.**
  * A screen displaying a list of current temperatures from 20 cities
  *  A search bar for filtering these cities
  * Items from the list can be able to be made a favorite, favourite cities should go to
    the top of the list
    
  * Clicking on the items should open an item screen displaying more detailed info of
   weather in that city
    
  * A notification showing the current conditions of a favorite city at the top of the hour
   (when the app is not in the foreground)
    
  * Please ensure the app works gracefully in and out of internet activity 
    
  * Write unit tests to validate that the app works well 
    
  * Please submit an apk with a link to the codebase on GitHub.
